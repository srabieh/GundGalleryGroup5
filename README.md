# Welcome to Gund Gallery Immersive Experience

This project provides an immersive experience of the Gund Gallery, using p5.js for interactive visualizations and a Node.js server with Socket.io and RESTful APIs.

## Overview

1. **Begin your Immersive Gund Gallery Experience!** - Browse through the virtual gallery and enjoy the interactive features for each artwork.
2. **Scan QR to fully experience Artificial Rock #85** - Scan a QR code to unlock additional content and an interactive experience for specific artworks.
